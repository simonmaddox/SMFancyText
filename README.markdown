# SMFancyText

Ever needed to format text, but didn't want the overhead of using a UIWebView? Say hello to SMFancyText. Simply give it HTML, and it'll render it into a UIView.

See sample project for usage.

## Only supporting iOS 6 or newer?

You'll probably want to use UILabel's `-attributedText` property now instead of this. If you're stuck supporting iOS 5, this project still might have some use.
